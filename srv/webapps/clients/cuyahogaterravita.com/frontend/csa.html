        <h3 id="csa-what-is-title">What is a CSA?</h3>
        <p>
          Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs unite farmers and families around fresh local food.
          Farmers grow a variety of vegetables in a natural, sustainable way and pick them at the peak of
          flavor and nutrition. The community supports their local farmers by purchasing shares of the harvest
          and picking them up each week during the growing season. Together the farmers and CSA members share
          in the rewards and risks of farming.

      <section class="csa-unique" aria-labelledby="csa-unique-title">
        <h3 id="csa-unique-title">What is unique about this CSA?</h3>
        <p>
          Located in the beautiful Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Greenfield Berry Farm aims to provide
          fresh, local, and naturally grown produce to our CSA members. Unlike a traditional single-farm CSA,
          we can provide consistent quality, quantity, and a wider variety of produce by working with other
          local farmers who share our passion for small-scale farming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the produce will be from our farm, but we can get items from other local farms when we have
          a slow week or when they have something special that we don’t.
        </p>
        <p class="csa-unique__perk">
          Even if something unexpected happens to our crops, our members will still get a share from the other
          farms that we work with.

        <h3 id="csa-shares-title">What is the cost and what is included?</h3>
        <p>
          We offer 3 share sizes: HALF, FULL, and FAMILY. All memberships include berries (when in season) and
          a weekly newsletter with storage, prep, and cooking ideas along with seasonal recipes and updates from
          the farm.

        <h3 id="csa-membership-title">What does my membership cover?</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to your weekly share of produce, your membership also covers: credit card fees; packaging;
          maintenance; and fuel costs to pick up items from our partner farmers when needed.
        </p>
        <p class="csa-membership__note">
          <strong>Share Sizes Vary With the Season</strong><br />
          The quantity of produce in each share will vary with the seasons and weather conditions. The largest
          shares will be in summer when most produce is in season and the smallest in winter.

      <!-- Vacation policy -->
      <section class="csa-policies" aria-labelledby="csa-policies-title">
        <h3 id="csa-policies-title">Vacation Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We have instituted a vacation policy for your convenience. Each family will be allowed <strong>3</strong> vacations
          per year. Families may choose to do one of the following <em>before 10am</em> on pickup day:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Donate</strong>: Request the share be packed and donated to a local foodbank and they will get the benefit of
            fresh locally grown food. Some of our partner farmers also donate to their communities, so your box may
            include items from them as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Give</strong>: Request that the share be packed and given to a friend that you send to pick up your box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double</strong>: Request that your next share be doubled up. Families with weekly shares will get 2x the boxes at the next
            pick up day. Families with bi-weekly shares may choose to get 2 boxes at their next scheduled pickup OR ask for a box the
            following week.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="csa-policies__note">
          These options <strong>must be requested before 10am on the day of pickup</strong>. Otherwise the share cannot be packed or
          stored and we cannot offer a refund.

        <p>
          We have chosen to eat locally and participate in this CSA as we try to live together in a more sustainable world. Our
          main goal is to grow healthy foods for each other. If the weather cooperates, there will be extra foods that will allow us
          to grow our farms and businesses. We all understand that weather and other emergencies can affect the foods grown, and we
          will share those risks as a community supporting agriculture.
