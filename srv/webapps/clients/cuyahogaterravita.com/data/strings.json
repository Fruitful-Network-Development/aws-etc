This season we will be creating a blog each week with 5 detailed recipes which utilize many, if not all of the ingredients in the week's package. This week's share includes many perennial herbs, which take off faster in the spring than the annual crops and offer an abundance of unique flavors. Check out our week 1 recipes below!"
    },
    {
      "string_2": "This week's recipes include two soups which fit perfectly into the cold, rainy weather we've been having. We included a light spring soup which uses many spring herbs, the Dutch Herb Soup. A variation of this recipe is suggested to originate as early as the mid 17th century. The recipe we included is a based on Christiane Muusers recipe translation from the original cookbook Keukenboek by Henriette Davidis from 1868. The original recipe calls for potato dumplings, which we swapped for plain potatoes due to time constraints, but we would encourage those who are slightly more ambitious to make potato dumplings or replace the potatoes with gnocchi."

      "string_4": "The recipes get hardier as we progress throughout the season. This weeks recipes include a braised celery dish which uses fresh tomatoes and baby celery. It's hard to describe how wonderful and fresh this taste. The baby celery complements the fresh tomatoes so nicely. The borage greens are used in a hardy soup dish that is very satisfying especially with a dollop of sour cream. We hope you enjoy using this week's share."

      "string_6": "This week's recipes are the simplest so far! They require the least amount of cooking and uses many of the vegetables in their raw state, which preserves their flavor and nutritional quality. The Garlicky Braised Greens with Balsamic Vinegar recipe below is a perfect way to use the delicious green tops of the double-whammy produce items- turnips and kohlrabi."
    },

      "string_7": "The recipes this week are very simple, meatless, and many make great sides for your Independence Day cookout! We included a hefty serving of white beans in two of the recipes, though beans could bulk up all 5 of the dishes. We used canary beans, which are a white kidney bean with a smooth buttery texture, but northern beans or navy beans would be fine substitutions."
    },
    {
      "string_8": "We wanted to incorporate the great outdoors into our cooking this week so the majority of the recipes were done on the grill, though they could easily be roasted in the oven with just a bit of cooking time added. We included a Peruvian herb this week called huacatay, or black mint. This herb is found in the marigold family, which you may recognize if you are familiar with the similar leaf structure and scent of the marigold plant. We recommend using the herb in a green sauce, which is our favorite way of enjoying most herbs- some garlic, oil, acid, salt, and pepper."

      "string_9": "This week we included an 8 herb mix which is versatile and flavorful, and perfect for summer cooking. The mix works well with roasted meats and vegetables, as well as in vinaigrettes or vegetable salads. We recommend removing the thicker stems from the herbs and then finely chopping everything in the bag to create one mix.Below is a recipe for one of our favorite vegetable soups of Eastern European origin which uses many of the ingredients in this week's share- Red Borscht Soup. We had a lot of 'wow, that's good' moments when we were cooking the recipes this week, so if you give these recipes a try we don't believe they will disappoint. In the words of Jacques Pepin, happy cooking!"

      "string_11": "We have lots of tasty summer vegetables included in the share this week. The recipes don't use a lot of ingredients that aren't in your bag. Since we are in the heart of grilling season we used the grill for most of the meals. The corn didn't get as big as we would have liked but it is very delicious. The corn in your shares were picked that morning which helps retain nutrient content and makes the corn extra sweet. It's best to eat corn as soon as you can after it is picked. We included two ways to grill the corn. We recommend grilling corn instead of boiling it. When you boil corn you loose all of its water soluble nutrients. We hope you enjoy these summertime recipes!"

    {
      "string_12": "The five recipes below provide a nice balance to one's weekly meals, with a soup, a salad, a sauteed green, and two starch heavy dishes- one rice, one pasta. This week we included a savory herb mix which contains seven unique herbs. Four of the herbs are easily distinguishable- sage (large, smooth leaves), oregano (smaller fuzzy leaves with a rigid stem and some flowers), marjoram (tiny leaves with a highly aromatic, florally flavor), and lavender (beautiful purple flowers with a heavenly aroma). The other three look and taste very similar, but upon close inspection they each have unique characteristics. The most easily differentiated is winter savory, which has smooth firm leaves and a spicy bite. As a hardy perennial this plant has a woody and semi-evergreen appearance. It's cousin, summer savory, is not as hardy, and it's small leaves and tender stems contain a less bitter bite, but still have a very complex aromatic flavor. The last herb included in the mix is thyme, which is the most mild flavored of the three, and also has the most tender leaves. The best way to use the herb mix is to strip all the leaves from the stems and finely chop everything together. To dry the mix for later use spread the herbs in a thin layer on your countertop and allow to dry over several days, and then place the mix to a sealed contained. Try the recipes below to find out how versatile this mix of herbs really is!"

      "string_16": "This week's recipes provide a lot of versatility due to the fact four out of the five recipes are primarily sauces which could be applied to pasta, pizza, sandwiches, or paired with other grains such as rice, quinoa, or couscous, buckwheat, etc. The sauces all fall in the creamy category so they're a combination of vegetables with some indulgent fat."

      "string_17": "This weeks share includes dense vegetables that make nice hardy food as the weather starts to turn early this year. These meals are sure to warm the body and soul. The weather and pumpkin in this weeks share are a sign that fall is here early. I highly recommend the soup recipe, it is perfect for these cool evenings."
    },
    {
      "string_18": "This week we included a fermented summer squash recipe which has really great flavor. Usually lacto-fermentation is associated with cabbage in the form of sauerkraut, but almost anything can be fermented to create a tangy flavor, including eggplant, radishes, and tomatoes. So if you find yourself with extra veggies, give fermentation a try!"

This is the first time that we have included the golden nugget squash in the share. We use this with the swiss chard in a wonderful rice pilaf recipes. Only one more week to go. We hope you have enjoyed cooking all of the produce we work so hard to cultivate this year."

They all work well as a main corse or can be used as a complemeant to any main dish. If you would like to add some protien to these meals you can always top them with some grilled chicken. We hope you enjot this weeks recipes."

      "string_28": "This beautiful spring weather has our herb garden yielding in abundance, which makes for some really flavorful food! The chimmichurri chicken recipe is quick, delicious, and healthy. It is also a great way to use up all of that cilantro. You can always freeze the chimmichurri and add it to cooked rice anytime. We also want to mention the kale and bean soup. This is a great soup that will fill you up. A quick note on the herbs included this week- baby celery greens and parsley are obvious cousins, but they can be differentiated by the deeper green and thinner stems of the parsley, but most obviously with a little taste. It's amazing something that two greens that look so similar can have such distinct tastes. We hope you all enjoy the recipes this week!"
    },
    {
      "string_29": "The wide variety of ingredients in this weeks share makes for some very tasty meals this week. The roasted chicken recipe is a great use of the lemon balm. It takes a little extra work because you have to stuff it under the skin but the final product is worth it. We said this in the flyer but it is worth repeating- store the lemon balm like you would basil, don't put it in the fridge. The gardens are growing and we have a lot more ingredients to work with as the season pushes on."
    },
    {
      "string_30": "The weather is great for growing produce. The shares are getting bigger as the season continues. This week we have fennel for the first time this year. Fennel pairs great with orange and we used that pairing with escrole to make a very healthy and tasty salad. We hope you enjoy our week 5 recipes!"
    },
    {
      "string_31": "We're really pleased with the range of color included in the share this week. We've included beautiful golden beets, purple top turnips, and the first of our summer carrots. The great part about all of these root crops is that all of the green tops are edible and delicious! We made a wonderful root vegetable dish that has a lot of flavor with not a lot of ingredients. We also included a few versions of pestos which show the range of delicious flavors leafy greens have to offer. We hope you enjoy the recipes this week!"

    {
      "string_32": "We're a quarter way through our CSA program, and we've got another great week of vegetables and recipes! We love combining different vegetable textures and levels of cookedness all in one dish. Check out the recipes below for some savory, salty, and tangy ways to enjoy the share this week!"
    },
    {
      "string_33": "The tomatoes are finally here and we are very happy to use them in the recipes this week. We also included peppers and tomatillos in the share for the first time this year. That means that we get to use some great ingredients. The salsa recipe is the perfect use of the tomatoes and tomatillos, and is very easy to make. We also have a delicious potato salad. Both dishes are perfect for barbecues. We hope you enjoy the recipes we have for you this week!"
    },
    {
      "string_34": "Through the heat and buckets of rain we've been hard at work putting in the next succession of many crops, and seeing the fruits of our labors with many others planted earlier this season. This week we've got a nice blend of leafy greens, root crops, and summer tomatoes. We included beautiful chioggia beets, which have striped concentric rings throughout the core. We used them in a borscht because the combination of beets, cabbage, and carrots is heaven, but they are also commonly eaten lightly boiled in a salad."
    },
    {
      "string_35": "This week we've included a lot of the lovely fruits of summer- tomatoes, peppers, and tomatillos. Though tomatillos are most commonly used in a salsa verde, they're also delicous in soup, like in the recipe below. We also included rutabaga, which is a milder and meatier cousin of turnips and radishes. Rutabaga can be used as a potato substitute, but is also tasty raw, with hints of kohlrabi and cabbage in the flavor. All of the gardens have been soaking up this sunshine and within a few weeks we should have mature winter squash. We've been seeding and caring for our fall and winter transplants, so we're well prepared for a bountiful summer and fall. Enjoy this week's vegetables!"
    },
    {
      "string_36": "This weeks share includes heirloom tomatoes and heirloom eggplant for the first time this year. We grow several different types heirloom tomatoes which you will get to sample throughout the season. This week most of the heirlooms included are either pink brandywine or chocolate stripe. We also included the first of the passilla bajoi peppers, which are used to make mexican mole sauce, and an early sweet banana pepper, with many more on the way! last year we grew a variety of super hot peppers which made a super hot sauce, but otherwise overpowered everything when cooking. So this year we made it a point to grow peppers that aren't super hot but have more sweetness and complex flavors. We hope you enjoy the share this week!"
    },
    {
      "string_37": "It's definitely tomato season! This week we included red romas, which have a thick pulp making them perfect for salsas and sauces, and also orange cocktail tomatoes, which have a sweeter and fruitier flavor than red tomatoes. Gazpacho soup is a perfect applicaiton for raw tomatoes, and we included a delicious recipe below. Luckily all of this rain has been a blessing for us because all of our fields have great drainage, and these cold temperatures won't hurt our tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, and cucumbers because they are all protected in high tunnels. We've begun transplanting our fall crops and our fields are still loaded so we will have many more vegetables for you on the way! Thank you for supporting our farm."
    },
    {
      "string_38": "This week we included a nice sampling of our herb garden for some unique and refreshing flavors. The mexican mint marigold (glossy leaves with little orange flowers) pairs with the Russian Tarragon (long skinny leaves) to add more anise flavor which results in a flavor similar to traditional French tarragon. This tarragon combination pairs well with chicken and fish. Also included is sage, which makes everything more fragrant. The carrot tops also make a useful herb, and when used with parsley they make a delicious chimichurri sauce (recipe on blog!). Have fun experimenting with some new flavors this week!"

    {
      "string_39": "We've reached the halfway point! Thank you for participating in the first half of our CSA program, and we look forward to provide you with fresh, seasonal vegetables for the next few months. We're starting to include all of late summer's bounty, including an abundance of winter squash. This week we included buffy squash, which has a sweet flesh, and can be stored for 6 months on your countertop. Like all winter squash it is delicious boiled, mashed, baked, roasted, stuffed, and even microwaved. Also, keep in mind any vegetables you don't get to throughout the week store well for winter when blanched and frozen. Let us know how you use your veggies and tag us @Front9farm!"
    },
    {
      "string_40": "This week we included both sweet and hot banana peppers. If used all together the mix is mildly hot, but if you want to use the peppers individually you could chop the top off and smell for sweetness or heat. The winter squash this week is baby blue hubbard which has a sweet and savory flesh. Also included are sweet bunching onions, which have a small tender white bulb and fresh greens which are delicious in any typical onion application. Two of the herbs this week are thyme and winter savory. Winter savory is related to summer savory, and has oblong leaves with a bit of spiciness. Thyme has a gentle flavor with lemony and minty tones. Enjoy the share and have a wonderful week!"
    },
    {
      "string_41": "This week we've included a crowd pleasing winter squash- butternut. Everyone has their favorite way to cook butternut. We love roasting it with some sausage, though we also highly recommend the butternut squash soup recipe below. the delicious herb lovage, a spicy cousin of celery is included. The leaves look similar but give them a taste and you will know the difference. A little goes a long way. We also included two nice of bunches of basil, which can be made into a pesto, then frozen, or dried for later use."
    },
    {
      "string_42": "We're aflush with summer's bounty! Our roma tomatoes are really hitting their stride so we included a hefty helping this week. These are the meatiest of the tomatoes which makes them perfect for sauces, salsas, and soups. We also included the first of our sweet corn, which we hope to include a few more times this season. The corn was harvested hours before the dropoff so it's near peak sugar content! We also included ground cherries, a sweet relative of tomatoes and tomatillos, which is another crop we will include more of from now until the end of the season. We hope you enjoy the variety this week, and thank you for supporting our farm!"
    },
    {
      "string_43": "This week we included spaghetti squash, which has a unique texture similar to pasta, and a mild flavor. This squash goes great with ratatouille or other tomato-based sauces. We also included some tasty summer treats- sweet corn and cantaloupe. We included a mix of pink brandywine and old German heirloom tomatoes. The flavor of both is exceptional, but they are highly perishable so we would recommend removing them from the paper bag to slow the ripening, and eating them within a few days. We hope you enjoy this week's share!"
    },
    {
      "string_44": "This week we included a big, delicious watermelon, which we've been patiently waiting for all season. They've taken their time getting ripe, but they were well worth the wait. We also included a sugar pumpkin, which is both cute to look at and great for cooking. On the blog this week we included a peanutbutter pumpkin soup recipe which is very tasty. We've still firmly in summer, and our tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant are chugging along, though a lot of our fall crops are sizing up and we look forward to the cooler temperatures bringing out their sweetness. Thank you for being a member of our CSA program, and we hope you enjoy this week's share!"
    },
    {
      "string_45": "Fall is finally here. Even though the weather is a bit colder we have plenty of wonderful veggies for the rest of the year. The cold weather will make the leafy greens produce more sugar and taste even more delicious than they already do. Butternut is a favorite winter squash among many CSA members and we have it again for you this week. We have some big projects coming up on the farm. There are a few more crops to transplant and then we will be installing hoops and covering a large portion of the garden, about 1/3rd of an acre, in greenhoiuse film and row cover. We plan to keep many cold-tolerant crops going throughout the winter months. Check our instagram and facebook this winter to see what winter markets we will be attending."
    },
    {
      "string_46": "This week's share includes several tasty members of the allium family- leeks and bunching onions. Both of these crops are primarily desired for their tender white parts, but the greens are delicious in their own right, and can be used in pestos, in soup stocks, or fried as crispy garnishes. We added some variety to the leafy green rotation by including radish greens, which are tasty sauted, or in a pesto, or in a soup, such as in the recipe on the blog this week. Thank you for supporting our farm, and have a wonderful week!"
    },
    {
      "string_47": "We cant believe it is already week 23. The turkeys are getting bigger by the day which is a constant reminder that thanksgiving is right around the corner. We have the beginnings of frost in the forcast so we're either covering or getting a final harvest out of all our summer crops. With the drop in temperature our root crops and leafy greeens should sweeten up. We still have a full 5 weeks planned for you, and many hearty recipes on the way. Thank you for supporting our farm and have a wonderful week!"

    {
      "string_48": "The count down to the last share is on and we are trying to figure out how to load you up with all of the goodies we have left in the garden. Our tomatoes are still going strong and we included a healthy amount of romas as well as beefsteak tomatoes this week. It feels like the weather has turned cold overnight which means everyone should stay inside and cook. We have some wonderful recipies with all of these great fall vegetables in the share this week. As always, thank you for supporting us."

      "string_49": "This past week we've had a couple of hard frosts which were a final bid farewell to our squash crops and uncovered peppers, eggplant, and tomatillos. Other parts of the garden, some covered, some not, are still going strong. This week we included some fall sweetness with sugar beets and butternut squash. We've included some tasty soup recipes on this week's blog which are simple but full of flavor. Be sure to eat your veggies this week to balance out that Halloween candy! Have a great week, and thank you for supporting our farm."

      "string_50": "It's been raining cats and dogs the past few days and on top of covering and seeding our winter crops we've been moving the animals and separating the sheep and goats for breeding. Next year we'll have more meat to offer along with all of our veggies. By March we should have plenty of pork to sell, and by next fall we should have grass fed lamb. Of course we will offer this to our csa members first. The weather is miserable so we recommend making the soup recipe below to keep you warm. The other recipes this week are delicous as well. Thank you all for supporting us and our farm!"

The recipe below and others on the website this week will fill you up on greens without leaving you hungry, despite several being meatless. The tatsoi is delicious to both humans and the flee beetles (tiny bite holes), and obviously pesticide-free. Similarly, the Chinese cabbage has sized up nicely but the early heat this past week has sent the plants into flowering. The brassica family is always a gamble in the spring but the nutritional and flavorful benefits make those crops worth the trouble. Thank you all for supporting us!"

Luckily most of our gardens have great drainage and our primary crops are planted in the best locations. Soon enough more fruiting crops will begin producing for us and you'll be seeing things from the squash and tomato families. This week we included some beautiful beets which are a two for one- delicious roots and greens. The greens are rich and delicious especially cooked, such as in the recipe below.

We've transplanted a TON of crops including beans, okra, winter squash, field tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant, so all of these veggies will be in abundance over the next few months. This week we harvested the first of our summer squash and zucchini. Tomatoes, peppers and eggplant from our high tunnels will be just around the corner. We're still loving all the spring greens which have great flavor this time of year. Enjoy the spring veggies while they last and have a great week!"

Below we've included a French recipe for endive which is the most common way to prepare the greens. Endive is also perfect in soups (such as Italian wedding soup) or sauteed with beans or garlic and a splash of vinegar.  We hope the fresh flavors this week brighten your day!

This week our crew transplanted a few hundred trays and we've been busy seeding several hundred more trays of succession crops. We've put together a great share this week including braising brassica greens which is a mix of curly kale, collard greens, and kohlrabi greens. The greens are delicious slow cooked, such as in the recipe below, in a soup or stew, or finely chopped in a salad with a creamy dressing.

This week's share includes basil and mint, which don't tolerate cold well, so leave the herb bag outside of the fridge. Have a great week!"

In the share this week we included some delicious heirloom tomatoes which have incredible flavor. We also included two delicata squash which, as the name suggests, have a delicate rind which softens when cooked and is therefore quite tasty. A few of our winter squash varieties have already matured so we will be including those over the next few weeks and months. Thank you for supporting our farm and have a great week!"

We like to let the squash speak for itself by dressing it with only butter or oil and some salt and herbs, or we make a really delicious dish and pack the center cavity with sausage and bake facing upward so the juices from the squash drip down into the squash.

We also included a tasty herb you may not be familiar with- sorrel. This herb has a bright, tart, lemony flavor which is delicious in many applications, including the recipe below. The gardens have been soaking up this sunshine and within a few weeks we should have many more mature crops including beans and corn, as long as the deer leave some for us...

We also included the cheery patty pan squash, which is delicious grilled, roasted, or sauteed. The green onion is a Japanese bunching onion which is a perennial harvested as a cut-and-come-again crop, and is delicious both raw and cooked.

This week we have more delicious spring greens. Now that the weather is cooperating we have finally started planting our summer crops out in the fields. This week we included a nice bulk bag of brassica greens, which are delicious sauteed. The heavier leafy greens will be included more in the earlier share of the season so if make sure you freeze them for use in summer if you're not eating them fast enough. If you don't know what to do with the brassica mix we highly recommend you make the pasta dish below. We try to make all the recipes has healthy as possible with minimal ingredients, and minimal animal products, but they can always modified to include more fats and cheeses, and can be served as side along a slice of meat.

      "string_80": "We survived the heat wave earlier this week, which the summer crops loved, and they should be producing fruit soon after soaking up all this sunshine. We planted tomatoes and peppers very early and usually end up cutting off the first fruit before it fully matures to allow the plants to grow bigger and produce more peppers in the long term, which is why the pepper in your bag is so petite. Soon the tomatoes and peppers will be producing lots of fruit and you will recieve larger quantities in the share. Spring is the best season for greens, so we included a full half pound of salad mix in the share this week. Us and our wonderful crew have been hard at work putting many many trays of everything from summer squash, to winter squash, to onions, and beans, in the ground, which will be ready for harvest during peak summer.

If you can't tell our lettuce crops are doing amazing. There is a hefty bag of salad mix this week which is loaded with lots of spring greens including spinach. Carrots are just starting to size up so we included a small bunch this week, with much more on the way in the future. The chimichurri recipe below and on the website is a great way to use the carrot tops so nothing goes to waste. The summer crops are just around the corner, and day by day we've been watching the summer fruits and vegetables size up. Enjoy the spring veggies while they last and have a great week!"

We are grateful to have them help us move the needle on production even through a very hot spring. We are on the cusp with so many crops, waiting for them to size up or ripen just a bit further. We wish we could  coax fruit out of the many of the crops we've been caring for since January, but it takes time. We hope you enjoy the variety this week, and make sure you eat the greens of all the crops as well as the roots/bulbs. They're delicious in their own right. We included some beautiful heads of bibb lettuce, which are really versatile, and are delicious in everything from sandwiches to soup (yes, check out the recipe online!). Thank you for supporting our farm!"

      "string_83": "We had a great week here on the farm. We almost have all of our garden space planted out, and plants are starting to produce. The whole Front 9 Farm crew has been working hard to put the next succession of vegetables in the ground. We harvested the first of our zucchini this week and included it in the share. We also included basil again this week. Be sure to store it on your countertop- not in your fridge, and loosely tie the bag closed so it doesn't wilt. The recipes are getting even better now that our summer crops are starting to produce. If you haven't done so already, check them out on our website. Also, if you're ever missing an item from your share, please let us know and we will replace it. We're pretty accurate, but sometimes we make mistakes packing. Have a great week!"

We hope you guys enjoy cooking with some new ingredients this week. we cant wait to see what everyone does with their shares. we recommend eating the peas as soon as possible since the lose their sweetness overtime. They would be great in a dish but taste great eaten raw as a snack. One of the benefits of our CSA is that we harvest everything the day of or the day before you get it, so if you keep everything cool and humid, produce items should last a week or two. This is especially true for lettuce, of which you received three different kinds this week. Thank you all for supporting us and our farm!"

      "string_85": "There's a lot of activity at the farm these days with so much to harvest. We have just 4 more beds of squash and onions to plant before we start prepping beds for fall and winter planting. We have lots of variety and everything is sizing up nicely. They should start making it into the bags within the next couple of weeks. Our zucchini got a little away from us this week so they are a little bigger than the size we usually pick. This just makes for a bigger meal. The website has a delicious sauteed red lettuce recipe, a dish which symbolizes wealth and prosperity in Chinese culture. it's a great use of the greens which are more bitter than bibb lettuce, especially this time of year, but have a much higher nutritional value. All of the meals this week are nice and light and use very minimal additional ingredients. We figured this was best after a long weekend of brats and beer. Happy 4th of july!"

      "string_86": "With so much going on at the farm, the zucchini got away from us a little this week, so there are some rather large zucchini in the bag which are perfect for zucchini fritters (recipe below), zoodles, or simply sauteed. We also included the first of our heirloom tomatoes in the bag this week. We used it in a BLT but would be great sliced with a little salt and pepper as well. Our summer vegetables are in full swing, and we're spending our days making sure everything is staying properly irrigated so fruit quality stays high. We hope everyone enjoys the veggies this week. Thank you all for supporting us and our farm, and do a rain dance for us!"

We've only had about an inch of rain in the past month, so each day we keep wishing the rain would swing over our heads, but it keeps missing us. We use drip irrigation for nearly all of our production space, so we're been able to keep most of our crops well irrigated, but they all look so much happier after a good soaking. The share this week has a nice variety of flavors with endless combinations, so the only limit is your creativity. We hope you enjoy the share this week and thank you for supporting our farm!"
    },
    {
      "string_88": "This week we included winter squash for the first time this year. The Delicata squash in the bag has been a favorite with many CSA members in the past. It is called Delicata because it has a delicate skin that you don't have to peel. We coated it with honey and grilled it in the recipes this week. Also making an appearance for the first time is Asian eggplant. This was used in a delicious stir fry with the collard greens and peppers. We've had a busy week as we're always thinking one season ahead- we've been seeding and transplanting tray after tray of fall and winter vegetables.  We hope you enjoy the share this week!"
    },
    {
      "string_89": "It feels like the weeks are flying by. We can't believe we are almost at the halfway point. The shares this week have great variety. Anytime the greens of the root crops (beets, carrots, etc.) are in at least OK shape we try to include them so you can cook with those as well, but when they haven't fared well against the weather, insects (we don't spray any insecticides), and hungry deer, we've been removing them more consistently. If you try the beet salsa recipe this week (on the website) we hope you find the main takeaway is that you can make delicious salsa out of nearly any vegetable. We also highly recommend the two part recipe below due to the versatility of the creamed greens, as well as the pickled stems. A quick pickle can perk up nearly any share item you aren't sure what to do with.  Have a great week!"
    },
    {
      "string_90": "Another heavy bag of delicious summer veggies this week. This week's share has a lot of diversity, including fresh celery, which is just starting to be large enough to harvest. The greens are really delicious, and full of flavor. We grew  single serving spaghetti squash that are in the bags which make a great two-person meal or side.We have a really strong winter squash crop this year, so we should be including a new squash nearly every other week, wihch are all unique and all have exceptional flavor. As usual, it's been a full week of turning beds over to the next succession. We've done a much better job of managing weed pressure this year versus previous years, so we're in a good position going into the fall to have some really strong fall crops. We hope you enjoy the share this week!"

    {
      "string_91": "It's hard to believe that we've reached the halfway point. Thank you for joining us on this journey through the seasons so far, and we can't wait to share the delicious vegetables we have growing for the second half of the season. Butternut Squash makes its first appearence in the bag this week. We used it in a soup with the swish chard but it is also great roasted with some sausage or any other way you like to enjoy it. You will get a lot of different winter squash for the rest of the year, and it all keeps really well so if you dont get around to making it right away it will store on the countertop for months. We've reached peak tomato season so enjoy them while they last- they won't be around forever. Thank you so much for supporting us and our farm!"
    },
    {
      "string_92": "We have another delicious winter squash for you this week -sweet dumpling, and just like delicata, it's flesh is tender enough to eat once cooked. For the first time this year we have tomatillos in the bag. Tomatillos are most commonly used in salsa verde but can be used in lots of other recipes as well. We love using them in soup (check out the recipe below). We had another busy very week on the farm as we straddle two seasons. We must keep up with harvesting and cultural practices for our summer crops while also seeding and transplanting those for fall and winter, but tray by tray we will reach the finish line. Thank you so much for supporting us and our farm!"

    {
      "string_93": "This week's share has great variety- a little of every flavor and texture. The butterkin squash in the share this week is a newer variety- a cross between a pumpkin and a butternut. It has vibrant orange flesh and sweet taste. We really enjoyed the shredded squash recipe this week. If you are running out of things to do with tomatoes we recommend the dip recipe below. It can be served hot or cold and is very addicting. We've hired more help to get us through fall, and we're continuing to spend the first half of our weeks planting all the vegetables that thrive once the heat of summer has passed.  Don't forget to tag us on social media with all your food creations. It's nice motivation for us during our long days in the field."

We are almost done planting our fall and winter crops. We're closing up our high tunnels each night which should help us extend the harvest of our summer crops. The acorn squash in the bag this week is perect for this time of year. It pairs nicely with apples, which are also in season, and you can find in abundance at the farmers' markets. The cooler temps also mean we will be including more soups in the recipes. This week we made a chorizo and kale soup, and a celery and potato soup. Both go great with crunchy bread or a grilled cheese. Thank you all for supporting our farm!"

      "string_95": "We have a lot of great produce in the bags for you this week. Our green bean crop is really starting to produce so we were able to include a large quantity of beans, and we hope to include more over the next few weeks. We're trying to squeeze the last bit of production out of many of our summer crops, which are becoming stressed by the changing temperatures and recent rainfall. This time of year really puts our crop management skills to the test, and we hope to carry our tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and winter squash along for a few more weeks or months. The leafy greens are becoming more tender as the weather cools down, and we hope to include more variety of greens as the fall season continues. Have a great week!"

We have lots of great produce and meals for you this week! Our green bean crop is producing well and there are lots of green beans in the share this week. We have a great recipe for those and for the green onions. The green onion-jalapeno bread on the blog this week takes a little preparation time, but it's definitely worth it! It pairs well with soups or with the pesto that we made from the green onion tops. We also took our last cutting of basil this week, which is always a harbinger of fall. Enjoy the produce and thank you for supporting us!"

    {
      "string_97": "Fall is here and we are down to the last 9 weeks. The last 9 weeks of the program are some of the best because we have so much variety. We are able to keep our summer crops growing in the greenhouse and the cooler season crops do well outside. We also dont have to worry about losing crops to pest as much. We are still hanging on to summer a little bit with a lot of great salsa ingredients in the bag this week. The recipe on the flyer this week is for a roasted salsa with tomatillos. We make a lot of salsa throughout the summer and we find that roasting the vegetables, especially the tomatillos, adds a nice depth of flavor to the salsa. We hope you all are having a great week!"
    },
    {
      "string_98": "We have been so busy around the farm it feels like the weeks are flying by! There is a great mix of vegetables in the share this week. We included a leek in the share this week, and there will be more in the future. Leeks are great as the base for soup. We used the leek, carrots and peppers in a soup recipe that is delicous. It is a nice fall soup that goes great with grilled cheese or just a nice slice of bread. We also included ground cherries for the first time this week. Ground cherries are in the tomato family but they are very sweet and almost have a pineapple taste to them. Make sure to remove the husk before you eat them. Most of you will probably eat them as a snack but they are great on salads, salsas, or spread on toast with cream cheese. Have a great week!"

We spend a lot of time harvesting this time of year. Make sure you follow us on social media to see our gardens, greenhouses, and also a lot of pictures of Annabelle. We really enjoyed all the recipes this week, and we hope you do, too! The hot pepper poppers this week make great tailgating snacks.

We've been busy preparing for the first significant frost of the season, so we're covering any cold-intolerant plants we hope to keep producing for another few weeks. This week's bag has a great mix of fresh flavors, including sorrel greens, which add a nice tanginess to soups or sauteed greens, and baby fennel, which has very flavorful, crisp fronds that work well in salads and soups. Have a great week!"

I'm sure most of you know but poblanos have a mild heat and a nice smokey flavor. We used it in a stir-fry along with the eggplant and sweet peppers. Below is a recipe for a borscht soup, it's a delicious hearty and healthy beet soup. If you haven't made borscht before you should try it!

We have two great soup recipes on the blog this week- a hearty chicken & rice, and a butternut squash soup.  We've been hustling this week to cover our plants which can survive the hard frost (28F) we're expecting this weekend. Many cold-tolerant crops only need protection from the dry cold air dessicating them. The upside of the cold weather is that the greens become sweeter after a few frosts as they increase their sugar storage in their leaves to help them survive the cold, and pest pressure is reduced. We have lots of great produce planned for the last three bags of the season!"

If you are not familiar with leeks you can think about them as a mild onion. They are incredibly versitile and can be used in many ways. We like to use them in the base of a soup which is how we used them in the recipe this week. We hope you all are still cooking along with us. Don't forget to share your creations with us @front9farm.

We were able to included cherry tomatoes one last time this week, as well as some tasty green tomatoes, which make an excellent chili. The past few weeks we've been busy transitioning our high tunnels into winter & spring production which we hope will last into the first few weeks of our 2021 CSA program.

Our broccoli crop was a bit stunted from the spring rain, so the initial  heads are small, but we should be able to have nice lateral cuttings once the plants grow larger. These are some of the tastiest carrots and radishes we've grown, and the roasted carrot recipe is delicious. Leave some of the tops on before roasting to incorporate some tasty greens into your dish.

We recommend cooking the broccoli greens using the most popular method to cook collard greens- in a liquid over low heat until they are tender. We actually grow them in place of collard greens because we find they're more versatile, since they also produce florets, and they survive the heat, pest, and disease pressure of summer just as well, if not better, than collards or kale. This is probably our heaviest bag yet, so hopefully you lifted with two hands. This will be the only time we include kabocha squash since the plants have started to fade from pest pressure, and because the tender skin of the squash reduces its shelf life, especially when the skin becomes mottled due to beetle bites. The tenderness of the skin also makes it tasty to eat, so if you roast it, don't skip the skin!"

Our peppers got a late start because we lost a lot of seedlings back in March & April to a soilborne disease caused by too much moisture and too low of temperatures.

We included a small amount of lunchbox peppers, which are insanely sweet and wonderful for fresh eating. Now that the weather is cooling down, it's the perfect time to make soup. We have great butternut soup recipe on the website, If you would like to make the squash soup a little richer add 1/2 cup heavy cream at the end.  Cabbage pairs really nicely with tomatoes in soups and stews, so if you have tomatoes piling up, that's a great way to use them. Thank you all and have a wonderful week!"

We've found that once it starts to develop a blemish, it's best to try and use it within a few days. Their thin skin doesn't lend well to long term storage. The squash is quite versatile, and unlike real spaghetti, it can be used in sweeter applications, such as baked with brown sugar, or in muffins, cake, pie, etc. It's feeling like soup weather, so we included three soup recipes on this week's blog. We highly recommend the borscht below. We made a blonde borscht with golden beets, but the purple beets included in the share are also delicious and add a savory, earthy flavor.

We have a great mix of cool season vegetables sizing up in the fields to be included in those final weeks. This week we included the last of our winter squash for the CSA season.

The first layer of protection we add is row cover, which gives us a few degrees of heat retention. When we see projected nightly temperatures crossing below 32F we'll start to pull down the greenhouse film we have secured to the tops of our low tunnels, and that will give us another few degrees of heat retention. Together those coverings allow us to keep tomatos/peppers/eggplant/ground cherries going until a hard frost at 28F or below. Everything else we have planted tolerates light frosts and we'll only start covering when the hard frosts hit. We included fresh potatoes in the share this week, which haven't been cured, so their skin is delicate.  We hope you're enjoying this fall weather, and have a great week!"

We still have a long transplant list we're trying to work through, though we are down to spinach, lettuce, beets, onions, and garlic.

The green onions have tubular leaves, and the leeks and garlic have flat leaves. The leaves of the green garlic are spicier than the leek leaves, which have a more onion-like flavor. We recommend slicing the leeks very thinly, especially to cut through the firmness of the flowering stalk, and then also finely chopping the leaves and flowering head. then sauteeing everything until golden brown.

We're most focused on irrigating the crops we've direct seeded into the field, and those we've transplanted, so that both become established and are able to push roots deeper into the soil to draw moisture. This week we included flowering leeks, which put out scapes just like garlic, and make a similarly delicious pesto (recipe below). THe base of the leeks can be used as well, though we would recommend slicing the leeks very thinly and simmering low and slow when cooking to tenderize the inner fibrous stem. We're happy to again include strawberries. This is only our third season growing strawberries, so we're still developing experience, but we're thinking the lack of rain has reduced the size and yield of the strawberries, despite many hours of drip irrigating. Nothing can replace a good rain."

This is the last week for strawberries. We're pleased with our yields over the past few weeks, despite the dry weather in late May/ early June.

The white onions in the bag are very sweet. They are much more parishable than the yellow & red storage onions we have included in the past so make sure you use them up quickly. The season feels like it is flying by. Fall is the best time for vegetables. We were a little late getting our winter squash in the ground, but they are sizing up nicely.

Over the past few years we've intentially reduced the amount of leafy greens (lettuces, kale, Swiss chard, brassica greens etc.) we include in the shares, because the feedback we received from CSA customers was those were the items they struggled to use up before they went bad. Our primary goal is for our CSA customers to eat the vegetables we include in the shares, so the denser vegetables we now include more of also have a longer shelf life. We try to strike a balance, so we aim to include 1-2 leafy items per week throughout the season. Our fall crops are looking great, and we finally started harvesting our winter squash, so we'll be including more of that over the next few months. Have a wonderful week!"

We'll still be transplanting fall alliums, mostly garlic and onions, right up to Thanksgiving, which will then be harvested next May/June/July.

You can pull it out in the middle of winter, make a delicious soup, and think about us. Speaking of winter, don't forget to come see us at one of the two winter Farmers Markets we attend. Both our outdoor markets continue until the end of October, and then the CVFM in Howe Meadow moves indoors to Old Trail School next door.

They are pesticide-free,so feel free to eat them right out of the container. The leeks are overwintered and have great flavor, but we would recommend giving them a good cooking, either by sauteeing them or using them in a soup, like the recipe on our blog, because their centers are a bit firm.

We cut them off so the plant devotes all of it's energy to enlarging the bulb. The scapes are delicious raw, in a pesto, or sauteed in place of garlic cloves.

The white onions also overwintered, which lead some of them to send up a flowering stalk in the center of the bulb. The stalk is edible, and has great flavor, but it is more fibrous than the rest of the onion, so you would want to finely chop it, or cook it until it softens.

In between trying to keep all the plants and seedlings alive and watered, we've put in a lot of hours and sweat into baling and stacking hay for all of our sheep for winter. We should only need to do one more big cutting of 300-400 bales to have enough hay for winter.

We also started harvesting our spring carrot crop this week, which are tasty and tender. We're starting to tip into the time of year where we spend more time harvesting than transplanting and weeding, which is encouraging.

We do try to maximize our growing space by planting other crops such as beets and lettuce in and among the tomatoes. We included freshly harvested white onions, and peppers, which together with the tomatoes make a delicious salsa. Later in the season we should have fresh cilantro, as long as it germinates well, which is never a guarantee. We recommend including the beet greens with the Swiss chard when cooking.

We're hitting peak season, where our crew spends as much time harvesting as they do transplanting, seeding, and weeding. We are making our last round of hay for our sheep this week, which we'll be happy to have this done for the year. We have been focusing on getting all of the tomatoes pruned and trellised up.

Romano beans are like green beans, you can eat the whole pod. They are best blanched and used in a recipe like the one below. They also work great in stir fries. We also included kabocha winter squash in the shares. These are probably our most popular winter squash at the farmers market, but they are more perishable than a standard winter squash due to their tender skin. The skin is tasty when roasted or sautted, and provides a good source of fiber, and the squash flesh has a rich sweet flavor. Enjoy your vegetables this week!"

We're very greatful for the rain we've had this past week. Thursday night's rain gave us a welcome relief from managing the frequent switches between irrigation zones on busy harvest days.

We're slowly starting to harvest our winter squash in fits and starts between harvests of the more time sensitive crops- tomatoes, peppers, and summer squash/zucchini. This is our first cutting of basil for the season, so the leaves are extra tender. Basil will become cold damaged if stored below 55F, and basil also likes a high relative humidity during storage, so we would recommend leaving the basil on your countertop with just a small opening in the bag for air exposure. The winter squash should also not be refrigerated. We included a sauerrkraut recipe on the blog this week, and we highly recommend giving fermentation a try sometime. it's very simple and a delcious way to enjoy the vegetables in a new way.

We're doing a lot of fall prep work and planting, much of it for vegetables we won't be harvesting until next year, such as onions, garlic, beets, carrots, cabbages, and some other members of the brassica family. This week we included the very popular winter squash Honeynut. It has an incredibly sweet and rich flavor. We made a soup after roasting a few earlier this week and were amazed at how sweet it was. We were also able to include a few tomatillos, which are a piquant relative of tomatoes, and commonly used to make salsa verde.

This time of year we've been including a lot of dense vegetables in the shares, which are less perishable than leafy greens such as lettuce, kale, etc. The feedback we've received over the years is that people do enjoy the leafy greens, but they are the vegetables most likely to go bad on them, so over the years we've worked to grow which last longer and are more versatile. Leafy vegetables also don't taste as good throughout the heat of summer, so they will be added back in more quantities once we have cooler fall weather. We are excited to include corn in the shares this week. We don't spray pesticides at our farm so corn can be challenging to grow, but we're been sampling the ears and only found minimal bugs, and have also found the ears to be sweet and juicy. We have a wonderful corn salsa recipe on the flyer and our website. Have a great week!"

We try to put most of the winter squash in the shares around this time so that we don't keep repeating the same summer vegetables, and so that it leaves room later in the season for the more diverse fall vegetables we have growing that still need time to size up. The winter squash, especially butternut and honeynut, will last for months. If you do notice a soft spot or blemish start to develop on the squash, then you will want to cook it up within a week before it spreads throughout the squash. Luckily the squash in the butternut family form harder exteriors that are less desirable to squash bugs, which poke holes in the more tender skinned winter squash. The herbs in the share are all really versatile. They make great additions to tomato sauce if you have some tomatoes you'd like to cook down. everything except the basil will keep for a few in your fridge. Have a great week!"

Just a reminder that you can eat the skin of a delicata squash, though you can also eat the skin of any winter squash, but some have skins that are quite firm. We used it in a pizza recipe on the website. We included our first picking of tasty fall radishes, and we hope the crop continues to grow larger and larger each week, but with this hot weather we're crossing our fingers that they don't bolt on us and become woody.

We're really hoping for rain next week! We've been irrigating constantly, using mostly drip irrigation to conserve water, but things are getting quite dry. This drought is becoming more severe, and though we're not as bad off as some parts of the state which haven't had rain since June or July, we could really benefit from a few inches of rain.

Now all we need is some sunshine! We included a beautiful cutting of kale, which would be great finely chopped, and massaged, in a salad. A benefit of kale salads is that even once dressed they keep for a few days because the greens are thicker than lettuce. As we move into October we're keeping watch on the weather for any potential frosts. It would be great if a killing frost held off until November, like last year, so that we have another month to harvest field tomatoes, peppers, beans, summer squash, and winter squash.

We included a nice bunch of celery to help you through soup season. We also included our last cutting of basil in the shares this week. We're amazed the basil held on this long. Usually it's killed by basil downy mildew that develops under humid conditions, and also spreads up from the south much earlier in the season, but due to the dry weather over the summer, the fungus never took hold.

A lot of the heat is stored in the seeds, so removing those will make any dish you cook more mild. We also included sweet potatoes which are tender enough they don't need to be peeled when you cook them. now that the greens have been through some cold weather they are sweeter, and also crunchier since they have a lower water content.

We still haven't had a killing frost yet, which is very unusual for this time of year, so our field tomatoes, peppers, and winter squash are still hanging on, but barely.

We are excited to share all the wonderful varieties we are growing with all of you this year. Our cucumber crop is starting to produce, and we expect to include them next week. This is always a challenging part of the year for us. We had a very busy week with lots of planting and making hay for our sheep. We're working long hours, but we can see the results of the hard work."

We also included turnips with full green tops, which we only include a few times per season. The turnips can be cut into slices and included in salads, or they can be shredded and combined with shredded potatoes to make latkes. The greens are very nutritious and delicious when sauteed. We were able to include a few more carrots this week. They are sizing up nicely, and they're growing so well that we want to keep allowing them to grow larger before we harvest most of them."

Though the temperatures have been rough, the rainfall the past few weeks has been steady and abundant for us, so we're thankful our field crops are well watered in. This week we included both cilantro and parsley. The two herbs look similar, but the parsley's leaves are curlier and the cilantro leaves are more delicate. Be sure to use the golden beet tops in the same way you would use Swiss chard or spinach, which are in the same plant family. They have great flavor when sauteed."

We harvest them as fresh potatoes, so they have thin tender skin, which provides great texture and flavor, but they won't keep as long as storage potatoes, so be sure to use them within a few weeks. We included the last of our spring turnips in the share, which are a less spicy relative of radishes, and their greens are delicious when sauteed. This week we focused on harvesting the majority of our garlic crop and we started working through our potato harvest, which will spread out over a few weeks. We also focused on trellising up both our greenhouse and field tomatoes. We have to keep them well pruned to prevent fungal diseases, and to keep the plants producing nice sized tomatoes. If all goes to plan, we should be harvesting tomatoes up until Thanksgiving."

More of our fruiting summer crops are starting to put on more leaves and add to their yield including our pepper and bean crops. As they continue to produce we'll rotate through the different varieties we're growing. We're not including a lot of leafy greens throughout the summer months, but cooking the tops of both the carrots and beets are a great way to still consume nutritious greens. We're thankful this season has included consistent weekly rainfall, especially compared to last year's summer drought. As long as we can keep pest and disease pressure in check, our summer crops should keep yielding well for a few months."

We'll have to prioritize irrigating that area since we're not seeing much rain in the forecast. We're working hard to rein in some weedy areas, and also to give our trellised tomatoes a nice pruning and clipping before we let them grow wild for their final few months.Our bean crop is really starting to produce, so we'll be spending many hours picking beans over the next few weeks. Our small crop of sweet corn finally matured this week, and we selected the best ears for the shares, but we don't spray any pesticides so there's a chance you may find bugs."

After that the window will close for any plants to put on substantial growth before cold weather hits. We just need to keep chugging along!"

We just started harvesting our winter squash, so we'll be rotating through those varieties over the upcoming months. This week we included spaghetti squash, which has a noodle-like texture once it is cooked. The easiest way to cook spaghetti squash is to cut it in half, scoop out the seed cavity, and then roast it. We also included freshly harvested potatoes, which have tender and a delicious buttery flavor. Our field tomatoes are peaking with their first few flushes so we included a healthy share of roma tomatoes. They are ideal for sauce and salsa making because they have a lower water content than larger beefsteak tomatoes. They're commonly canned or frozen for later use."

We're still focused on seeding plants for fall and winter as our window for fall growth is closing fast. We appreciated the unexpectedly abundant rainfall earlier this week. The consistent rainfall throughout this season has really helped our fall winter squash crop to put on a lot of foliage, so we're hoping when harvest time comes we'll find a good amount of squash. The rainfall has also created an abundant mess of weeds in some sections, so we spend a solid day each week trying to tame those as well. We're hitting peak season on our summer crops, so we hope you enjoy this week's variety of tomatoes and peppers while they're here."

We've squeezed the last bit of hay we could from our fields for our sheep, and now we hope to graze them one last time over all of our acreage over the next 2-3 months before we move them to their winter structures. We have many little seedlings of fall crops throughout our fields including beets, cabbage, green onions, radishes, lettuce, and carrots. They should mature to harvestable size over the next 1-2 months. Our plan is to continue weeding and seeding over the next month or so, though the crops we seed towards the end of period won't be ready until late winter or early spring. This week's share has all the ingredients to make some really great mexi dishes, including the golden beets which can make a delicious golden beet salsa (which you'll have to google)."

They are often cut in half and then roasted, often being stuffed with meat or a rice mixture. Our summer crops are holding on, and with these cool evenings we're going to need to keep an eye on lows so that we can cover any crops we want to extend farther into the season."

We're happy to include greens again this week. This will probably be the last week we can include beans, unless they surprise us with a flush of flowers that matures before cold weather strikes. This late drought has kept us watering everyday, but the dewy mornings are helping a bit. We hope the rain forecasted for next week arrives. So far we don't see any frost warnings in the forecast, but we'll need to keep a tight watch on the weather so that we give ourselves enough time to lower all our low tunnels so we can extend the harvest on many of our warm season crops"

We have to be thankful for several days of rain because we're still well below the average for the month, and we're not seeing any rain in the forecast. The rain helped our recent seedings of spinach, onions, radishes, and beets, which we'll harvest from late fall through early spring. We were able to include a good amount of greens this week including lettuce, kale, and cilantro. This will probably be our last cutting of cilantro, so be sure to freeze it if you don't think you'll use it all over the next two weeks."

We included our first harvest of crunchy radishes this week. White icicles have a great flavor that's not too spicy and they grow long and tender, which we enjoy more as growers than the smaller rounder radishes that become woody faster. The delicata squash does not need to be peeled before eating, the skin becomes tender when cooked."

We're both doing really well, her name is Coralie Alora Myers. The season's are definitely changing, we had our first light frost this past week. We covered a lot of our field tomatoes, peppers, and sweet potatoes, though thankfully the frost was pretty light and the soil has a lot of residual heat from these sunny days, so nothing was damaged. All of our crops are looking very healthy despite it being so late in the season, so we'll continue to harvest these crops until they are killed by the frost. This week's share is perfect for soup making. Everything together (minus the beets and tomatillos) would make a delicious minestrone."

We're also about halfway through harvesting our sweet potatoes, so we'll let those cure for 2 weeks and then we'll include them in the final shares. We'll also have other root crops which get sweeter with the cold weather that we will include in the final shares. We hope you enjoy the last of the summer crops, because once they're gone we won't have them again until next summer."
