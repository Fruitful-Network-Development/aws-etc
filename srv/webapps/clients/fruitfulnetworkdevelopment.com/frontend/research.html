        <p>The Small Business Innovation Research (or SBIR) program is a U.S. government funding program, coordinated by the Small Business Administration, intended to help certain small businesses conduct research and development (R&amp;D). Funding is provided through contracts or grants. The recipient projects must have commercialization potential and meet specific U.S. government R&amp;D needs.</p>

            <p class="muted">National Program Leader: Carlos Ortiz, PhD</p>
            <p>Improve the quality of life in rural America by creating and commercializing technologies that address important economic and social development issues or challenges in rural America.</p>
            <p>Explicitly discuss the specific rural problem or opportunity that will be examined and how the proposed science-based technology will successfully address the problem or opportunity.</p>
            <p>Include an objective to assess the impacts of the proposed project on protecting or enhancing the environment, on climate mitigation or adaptation, or the socio-economic development of rural areas.</p>
            <p>Can focus on any area that has the potential to provide significant benefit to rural Americans.</p>
            <p>USDA seeks a balanced portfolio that mixes high risk, high reward innovations with new applications of existing technologies.</p>

            <p class="muted">National Program Leader: Dr. Rachel Seman-Varner</p>
            <p>Promote and improve the sustainability and profitability of small and mid-size farms and ranches.</p>
            <p>Small farms are those with annual sales of agricultural products less than $350,000 and between $350,000 and $999,999 for mid-size farms.</p>
            <p>Small farms account for 90 percent of all U.S. farms and play an important role in the agricultural sector. The viability and sustainability of small farms are important to the nation’s economy and to the stewardship of our biological and natural resources.</p>
            <p>Emphasize how projects contribute to the well-being of rural communities and institutions.</p>
            <p>Emphasize how results will be disseminated to other small farmers and provide benefit to the small farm community.</p>

        <h2>Open Source Novel Technology</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">How the Mycite Framework supports rural producers</p>
      </div>
      <p>FND's novel data technology is a system where local producers can digitally offer up their supply (in stock or expected) from the same data they manage their farm operations. This creates a shared data infrastructure that is just as seamless and efficient as what big agriculture uses in a top down model. This enables them to improve local economies, maintain a personal touch, and compete on product quality; without giving up any autonomy or control of their farming operations or their digital rights. There is a public demand for sustainably grown, local, healthy options and but the current system makes it financially and logistically hard to incorporate local producers. As a result, these farms under perform their industrial counterparts at about 10% per acre; just with respect to output of perishable crops that can't be planned for growth due to isolated suppliers, buyers and middle shops. Producers manage their website, inventory, POS, taxes, farm planning, and events through our desktop application. This aims to revolutionize the industry by creating the first refrigerated trucking and produce brokerage optimized for small agricultural producers at the same level as large industrial partners.</p>
