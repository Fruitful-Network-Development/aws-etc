              <h2>Cleveland’s Greenhouse Industry (Historical)</h2>
            </header>
            <p>From the late 19th century through the mid‑20th century, Greater
              Cleveland became the “Greenhouse Capital of America.” Martin Ruetenik
              built the first greenhouse in Brooklyn Heights in 1885, and by the
              mid‑1920s about 50 businesses maintained 80 acres of greenhouses,
                  growing tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. The
              industry expanded to 400 acres under glass by the early 1960s,
              employing roughly 1,000 hothouse farmers—many of them Puerto Rican
              migrants. Produce was sold through roadside
              stands, markets and the Northern Ohio Food Terminal, enabling
              restaurants and households to enjoy fresh vegetables year‑round. Cheap
              coal made heating affordable early on, but rising energy costs,
              pollution and competition from Canadian greenhouses in the 1970s led to
              decline.</p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Rise and Decline</h3>
                <p>Greenhouse farming was labour‑intensive and expensive, requiring
                  misting systems, boiler‑heated steam pipes and careful pollination.
                  The R.O. Apelt Sons operation grew to 3.5 acres by 1959 but
                  dismantled its greenhouse in 2016, illustrating the sector’s
                  collapse. Many operators switched to
                  flowers or closed entirely as Canadian subsidies tilted the market.</p>

                <p>The Northern Ohio Food Terminal opened in June 1929 on a 34‑acre site
                  and once housed 100 merchants, employing about 1,500 people and
                  handling roughly $140 million worth of food annually. During the late
                  1950s and early 1960s the terminal distributed nearly $200 million
                  in produce each year, making it a vital
                  organizing hub for regional agriculture. Produce arrived via railcars

              <h2>Parker Bosley – Cleveland’s Local Food Pioneer</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Parker Bosley, often called the “grandfather of Cleveland’s local food,”
              grew up on a dairy farm and studied cooking in Paris before opening
              Parker’s New American Bistro. Over two decades he built a menu that
              relied exclusively on foods produced by Ohio and nearby Pennsylvania
              farmers. His menu changed daily to reflect what was in season, and he
              visited farms to encourage specific varieties and breeds.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h3>Fair Prices & Farmer Relationships</h3>
              <p>Bosley cultivated a network of cheese producers and small farms,
                paying farmers a premium (e.g., $10 per pound for artisan cheese) to
                ensure profits flowed directly back to them. He championed small‑scale,
                sustainable farming and challenged the notion that cheap food should
                come at the expense of natural resources and rural economies. His advocacy laid the groundwork for Cleveland’s farm‑to‑table movement.</p>

              <h2>Food Terminals & Produce Auctions (Historic)</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In the early 20th century, food terminals were the primary organizing
              facet of local agriculture. Cleveland once hosted seven or eight
              terminals, relying on local farms to supply these bustling hubs. Produce
              trains from the West Coast—called “fruit blocks”—traveled east with
              perishable goods that often had priority over passenger trains. The
              Pennsylvania Railroad Fruit Auction & Sales Building in Pittsburgh’s
              Strip District, constructed in 1926, stretched about 1,533 feet long
              (roughly five city blocks). This massive warehouse allowed
              farmers and brokers to unload railcars directly into auction bays where
              fruit and produce were sold at dawn.  Auctions began
              early so goods could reach stores and restaurants by opening time, a
              logistical rhythm that kept regional food systems running.</p>
            <div class="info-card__layout info-card__layout--split">
              <div>
                <p>These terminals thrived thanks to the proximity of rail lines, but
                  as refrigerated trucking became widespread, rail‑based produce
                  distribution declined. Many terminals were demolished or repurposed;
                  only a handful of operations, like the Northern Ohio Food Terminal
                  (now Sanson Company) and the Consumers Produce facility in
                  Pittsburgh, remain today. The history underscores how
                  infrastructure shaped regional food economies and how transportation
                  innovations can shift the balance between local and industrial
                  supply chains.</p>

                    farm needs. These blends help over 1,000 farmers improve soil
                    health and balance nutrient levels, emphasizing long‑term
                    generational benefits. The program underscores the
                    cooperative’s commitment to regenerative practices and provides an
                    equitable alternative to conventional chemical inputs.</p>

                  Northeast Ohio growers and regenerative, organic and sustainable
                  artisans. Founded by Sasha and Jimmy Miller, the venture began as
                  Purplebrown Farmstead—a 12‑acre diversified permaculture farm
                  established in 2016 within Cuyahoga Valley National Park.
                  The farm grows mushrooms, pasture‑raised pork, eggs, cider apples,
                  berries and perennial produce using permaculture principles, and
                  is certified organic.</p>
                <p>In 2021, the Millers expanded from a farm stand to a brick‑and‑mortar
                  store to collaborate with other producers and make local food more
                  accessible. The store aims to provide everything needed for
                  nourishing meals while supporting the Ohio food and farm community.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Yellow Bird Food Shed (YBFS) is a distribution network founded in 2014 to
              decentralize the food system one customer at a time. Launched from
              founder Benji Ballmer’s house, it now occupies a 10,000‑square‑foot
              facility in Mount Vernon, Ohio, where staff receive, pack and store
              produce, dried goods and boxes for delivery. YBFS sources
              from a network of small, sustainable farmers so that growers are
              fairly paid and have stable access to markets. Unlike
              conventional CSAs, subscriptions are optional; customers who keep
              something in their cart every week receive a 5 percent discount.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h3>Decentralizing the Food System</h3>
              <p>By delivering locally grown food year‑round, YBFS overcomes
                limitations of farmers’ markets and ensures that consumers can shop
                locally even in winter. The flexible box model—no upfront
                fee, customizable orders and weekly discounts—attracts more than
                2,000 members. Each product is traceable back to the farm it
                came from, giving buyers confidence in the supply chain.</p>

                high‑nutrition bean and grain varieties with a USDA grant in 2007
                and launched the Appalachian Staple Foods Collaborative in 2009.
                Community volunteers, lenders and friends helped them
                build the first certified organic mill in Ohio in 2010.
                Shagbark emphasizes that local grain systems require collaboration
                between farmers, millers, bakers and consumers.</p>

            <p>Rust Belt Riders is a Cleveland‑based service that collects organic
              waste from restaurants and redistributes it to local farms and gardens
              as fertilizer. The company began with co‑founders Daniel Brown and
              Michael Robinson riding a bicycle with a trailer to pick up food
              scraps from restaurants. By turning waste into compost,
              they close the loop between urban eateries and regional farms.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h3>Scaling Up Through Policy & Partnership</h3>
              <p>Composting at scale required a Class II composting permit and a
                suitable site. Rust Belt Riders worked with the Ohio EPA to expand
                the exemption for community compost piles from 300 to 500 square
                feet, enabling more gardens to compost legally. They later
                partnered with Kurtz Brothers to secure the Cloverleaf Composting
                Facility, allowing them to produce more compost in one month than
                they previously could in a year. Their potting mixes have
                been ranked among the best in research trials and they were named
                Best Small‑Scale Composter in the U.S.</p>

                  Melanie Brunty began raising pasture‑raised animals nearly 20 years
                  ago to offer neighbors meat they could trust. As their farm
                  expanded, they realized the need to control processing and opened a

                <p>Heinen’s is a regional grocery chain that has long supported local
                  farmers. Each summer, their produce departments transform into
                  daily farmers markets, featuring the best fruits and vegetables
                  from local fields. The company maintains relationships with
                  farmers it has been buying from for decades, ensuring a reliable
                  market for growers.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Heinen’s buyers frequently travel to Wayne County to purchase
                  produce from Amish growers at auctions, and selections often arrive
                  in stores the next morning. This direct farm‑to‑store supply
                  chain minimizes handling and preserves freshness, demonstrating
                  how a larger retailer can sustain local agriculture.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Family‑owned since 1932, Buehler’s Fresh Foods is an Ohio grocery
              chain recognized for supporting local farmers. The company provides
              locally grown produce and natural meats from providers such as Gerber
              Poultry and the Mt. Hope Farmer’s Produce Auction. Buehler’s is the
              largest purchaser at the Mt. Hope auction, helping sustain growers from
              Holmes and Wayne counties.</p>
            <div class="info-card__mini info-card__mini--accent">
              <h3>Largest Mt. Hope Buyer</h3>
              <p>Anchor purchasing keeps Amish and small‑scale growers moving steady
                volume.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This commitment to sourcing from nearby farmers not only guarantees
              freshness but also keeps dollars within rural communities. Buehler’s
              history of community engagement illustrates how a mid‑sized retailer
              can anchor local food systems.</p>
