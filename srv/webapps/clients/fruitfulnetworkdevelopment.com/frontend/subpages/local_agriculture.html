  This HTML file contains a collection of info cards summarizing
  various business models and historical examples of equitable
  approaches to local agriculture in Northeast Ohio. Each card
  highlights a unique organization or practice, describes its
  mission or historical significance, and ends with clickable
  source links. Comments throughout the markup explain the
  layout vision for each card (e.g. two-column grids, image
  placements, or sub-sections). No CSS is included because
  styling will be handled externally; however, structural classes
  are added for future styling (e.g. `.info-card`, `.subsection`).

        <p>The Oberlin Food Hub is a nonprofit founded in 2017 to build an efficient, equitable regional food system. It supports sustainable agriculture and small- and mid-size producers while ensuring consistent access to healthy, affordable food for communities. The hub offers a centralized ordering platform and manages logistics—aggregation, cold storage, invoicing and customer service—so farmers can focus on growing food. It purchases products from area farms and supplies them to food banks, independent grocers, colleges, restaurants and farm stores.</p>

          <h3>Equity Focus</h3>
          <p>By pooling supply from many small farms and handling logistics centrally, the Food Hub creates fair market access for growers who might otherwise struggle to reach wholesale buyers. The organization emphasizes fairness, transparency and shared prosperity; it plans to expand services with a shared-use kitchen incubator to process Grade B produce and build climate resilience.</p>

      <p class="info-card__eyebrow">Historic infrastructure</p>
      <h2>Cleveland’s Greenhouse Industry (Historical)</h2>
    </header>
    <p>From the late 19th century through the mid-20th century, Greater Cleveland became the “Greenhouse Capital of America.” Martin Ruetenik built the first greenhouse in Brooklyn Heights in 1885, and by the mid-1920s about 50 businesses maintained 80 acres of greenhouses, growing tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. The industry expanded to 400 acres under glass by the early 1960s, employing roughly 1,000 hothouse farmers—many of them Puerto Rican migrants. Produce was sold through roadside stands, markets and the Northern Ohio Food Terminal, enabling restaurants and households to enjoy fresh vegetables year-round.</p>
    <div class="info-card__layout info-card__layout--split">
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Rise and Decline</h3>
        <p>Greenhouse farming was laborious and expensive, requiring misting systems, boiler-heated steam pipes and careful pollination. Cheap coal initially made heating affordable, but rising energy costs and pollution in the 1960s and 1970s, coupled with competition from Canadian subsidized greenhouse producers, led to a rapid decline. Many greenhouses closed or switched to flowers and ornamental plants. The R.O. Apelt Sons operation, once a 3.5-acre hothouse producing cucumbers, dismantled its greenhouse in 2016 after switching to hydroponic cucumbers in 2000.</p>

      <h2>Rust Belt Riders</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Rust Belt Riders is a Cleveland-based service that collects organic waste from restaurants and redistributes it to local farms and gardens as fertilizer. The company began with co-founders Daniel Brown and Michael Robinson riding a bicycle with a trailer to pick up food scraps from restaurants. By turning waste into compost, they close the loop between urban eateries and regional farms.</p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Scaling Up Through Policy & Partnership</h3>
      <p>Composting at scale required a Class II composting permit and a suitable site. Rust Belt Riders worked with the Ohio EPA to expand the exemption for community compost piles from 300 to 500 square feet, enabling more gardens to compost legally. They later partnered with Kurtz Brothers to secure the Cloverleaf Composting Facility, allowing them to produce more compost in one month than they previously could in a year. Their potting mixes have been ranked among the best in research trials, and they were named Best Small-Scale Composter in the U.S.</p>

      <h2>Parker Bosley – Cleveland’s Local Food Pioneer</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Parker Bosley, often called the “grandfather of Cleveland’s local food,” grew up on a dairy farm and studied cooking in Paris before opening Parker’s New American Bistro. Over two decades he built a menu that relied exclusively on foods produced by Ohio and nearby Pennsylvania farmers. His menu changed daily to reflect what was in season, and he visited farms to encourage specific varieties and breeds.</p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Fair Prices & Farmer Relationships</h3>
      <p>Bosley cultivated a network of cheese producers and small farms, paying farmers a premium (e.g., $10 per pound for artisan cheese) to ensure profits flowed directly back to them. He championed small-scale, sustainable farming and challenged the notion that cheap food should come at the expense of natural resources and rural economies. His advocacy laid the groundwork for Cleveland’s farm-to-table movement.</p>

Founded by Sasha and Jimmy Miller, the venture began as Purplebrown Farmstead—a 12-acre diversified permaculture farm established in 2016 within the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The farm grows mushrooms, pasture-raised pork, eggs, cider apples, berries and perennial produce using permaculture principles, and is certified organic.</p>
        <p>In 2021, the Millers expanded from a farm stand to a brick-and-mortar store to collaborate with other producers and make local food more accessible. The store aims to provide everything needed for nourishing meals while supporting the Ohio food and farm community. It also features beverages from B-Certified and carbon-neutral producers, reflecting a commitment to sustainability.</p>

        <p>The Farmer’s Rail grew out of Brunty Farms, where Jeff and Melanie Brunty began raising pasture-raised animals nearly 20 years ago to offer neighbors meat they could trust.

Today the Farmer’s Rail includes restaurants with from-scratch kitchens and continues to supply Brunty Farms’ meats alongside products from other local vendors.</p>
        <p>This vertical integration—from pasture to butcher to table—ensures transparency and fair compensation to farmers while providing consumers with high-quality, locally sourced meals.

  <!-- Food Terminals & Produce Auctions (Historic) Card -->

    <header class="info-card__header">
      <p class="info-card__eyebrow">Historic supply chains</p>
      <h2>Food Terminals & Produce Auctions (Historic)</h2>
    </header>
    <p>In the early 20th century, food terminals were the primary organizing facet of local agriculture. Cleveland once hosted seven or eight terminals, relying on local farms to supply these bustling hubs. Produce trains from the West Coast—called “fruit blocks”—traveled east with perishable goods that often had priority over passenger trains. The Pennsylvania Railroad Fruit Auction & Sales Building in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, built around 1926, stretched 1,500 feet and spanned four city blocks. Fruit and produce were unloaded from railcars and auctioned in the early morning so goods reached markets and restaurants by opening time.</p>
    <div class="info-card__layout info-card__layout--split">
      <div>
        <p>These terminals thrived thanks to the proximity of rail lines, but as refrigerated trucking became widespread, rail-based produce distribution declined. Many terminals were demolished or repurposed; only a handful of operations, like the Northern Ohio Food Terminal (now Sanson Company) and the Consumers Produce facility in Pittsburgh, remain today. The history underscores how infrastructure shaped regional food economies and how transportation innovations can shift the balance between local and industrial supply chains.</p>
