In other words, we're building a system where local producers can digitally offer up their supply (in stock or expected) from the same data they manage their farm operations.
This creates a shared data infrastructure that is just as seamless and efficient as what big agriculture uses in a top down model. This enables them to improve local economies, maintain a personal touch, and compete on product quality; without giving up any autonomy or control of their farming operations or their digital rights.
There is a public demand for sustainably grown, local, healthy options and but the current system makes it financially and logistically hard to incorporate local producers.
As a result, these farms under perform their industrial counterparts at about 10% per acre; just with respect to output of perishable crops that can't be planned for growth due to isolated suppliers, buyers and middle shops.
